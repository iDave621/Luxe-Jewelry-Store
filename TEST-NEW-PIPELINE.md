# 🧪 Quick Test - New Modular Pipeline

Simple test run to validate the new pipeline works. **Not removing anything**, just testing!

---

## ✅ Pre-Test Checklist

1. **Verify Credentials in Jenkins** match `jenkins/config.groovy`:
   - `docker-hub`
   - `Nexus-Docker`
   - `snky`
   - `jwt-secret-key`

2. **Commit new files:**
```bash
git add jenkins/
git add Jenkinsfile.new
git commit -m "feat: add modular Jenkins pipeline for testing"
git push
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Steps

### 1. Create Test Job in Jenkins

1. Jenkins → New Item
2. Name: `luxe-jewelry-test-modular`
3. Type: Pipeline
4. Pipeline → Script from SCM
5. **Script Path:** `Jenkinsfile.new` ← Important!
6. Branch: `main`
7. Save

### 2. Run Test Build

Click "Build Now" and watch for:
- ✅ Modules load successfully
- ✅ Change detection works
- ✅ Stages run or skip correctly
- ✅ No errors

### 3. Make Small Change & Test Again

```bash
echo "// Test change detection" >> jewelry-store/src/App.js
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger frontend build"
git push
```

Run build again. Should see:
```
=== Change Detection Summary ===
auth-service   : ⏭️  SKIPPED
backend        : ⏭️  SKIPPED
frontend       : ✅ CHANGED    ← Only this builds!
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Pipeline works if:**
- ✅ All modules load
- ✅ Change detection identifies correct services
- ✅ Only changed services build
- ✅ Parallel stages run simultaneously
- ✅ Deployment succeeds
- ✅ Pods are healthy

**Troubleshooting:**
- "Cannot load config.groovy" → File not committed
- "Credential not found" → ID mismatch in config
- "All services build" → Expected on first run

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**First build:** All services build (~13 min)  
**Frontend change:** Only frontend builds (~11 min)  
**Old pipeline:** Always 32+ minutes

**If faster and works correctly → Success! ✅**

---

## What's Next?

**After successful test:**
- Keep both `Jenkinsfile` and `Jenkinsfile.new`
- Use whichever works best
- No need to remove old files yet

**That's it! Simple test, no migration, no removal.**
